            <h2>Beyond The Ordinary</h2>
            <h5>In any race you can win or lose.If you win you can lead and if you lose you can advise.</h5>
            <img src="beyond_ordinary.jpg">
            <p>We all start from a place of imperfection,If you do it they will criticize,if you don't they still will.</p>
            <h4>1. Do I like who I am right now?</h5>
            <p>This is a very important question to ask yourself,are you your true self?are you living an idea of ourself you built to reasure yourself?Are you fighting for the course that's importannt for you?
                Are you a person you can respect more?It's an amazing gift to be this self aware.To experience life an it's full meaning and to see beyond what meets the eye,you must not be a carefree caterpillar gone to it's cocoon.  
            </p>

            <h4>2. If I had not been born ,what would be different about the world?</h4>
            <p>My family would never get to experience the pleasure of my stupid jokes.We are not born just to live and die,In <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em>
            You have to ask yourself do you have a why?why were you born to your family and not the other?to your village and not the other?to your town and not the other?You have to find a purpose in your life.Something bigger than yourself.
            </p>

            <h4>3. What aspect of your personality do you need to change?</h4>
            <p>It's normal for us as humans to never find faults with ourselves,we want to believe that we are right,that our toxic personality is who we are and we cannot change.It takes the highest degree of self awareness to notice that we can change something about ourselves and this is the level of awareness needed to see things beyond what they are to what should be.</p>
            
            <h4>4. What would I do if my biggest dream came true today?</h4>
            <p>Our minds operate in literal terms,when you visualize something and feel the emotions while seeing the piture,your mind will take it literally as it is.You will act like that person,think like that person,you might not realize it but this is how we operate daily.Visualize your dreams and you'll realize how all the pieces come together.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Look fear in the eye</strong></li>
            </ul>
                <p>Resistance to change always presents it's self in the form of fear when you are breaking out of your comfort zone.Its's normal,it's okay.What's not okay is letting that fear take the best of you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Steal</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>You are not the first person to work toward achieving your dream.As such there's no need to try and reinvent the wheel.</p>

             <h4>Are we still masters to our colonialists?</h4>
             <p class="cont"> A critical look at the Western influence on African culture shows both good and bad influences. This has made much of African native culture give way to the European culture. Either by design or accident, Africans have imbibed the Western culture and have appropriated it so much that it now becomes almost part and parcel
                of their lives.It is also important to stress that colonialism distorted and retarded the pace and tempo of cultural growth and trend of civilisation in Africa.Today most of the nations in Africa should not even be called African nations, but western African nations. The language, political ideology, socio-economic structures, education, and everything that makes up a nation, even down to popular culture, do not originate from within these countries. African nations have a total dependency on foreign political philosophies and ideas, and their shifts and movements.</p>

                <h4>1. Western Culture</h4>
                <p>
                    Westernism is a coinage from the word westernize which refers to
                    the act of bringing ideas or ways of life that are typical of Western
                    Europe and North America to other countries. Therefore, western
                    culture connotes the knowledge, belief, morals and way of life of the
                    Western world.
                    <br>
                    Culture is learned,it is not transmitted biologically.It is what defines human beings annd distinguishes them from other human beings.
                    Our colonizers brought with them the brilliant idea of <strong>Education</strong><br>In African Traitional set up,our fore-fathers were pretty much satisfied with how they were before the missionaries came.Then came <strong>Education</strong> is through education that we learn critical thinking.We get to share tables with kings and dine with presidnts through education.It is through the same white education that we have developed good communication skills,so the question of discrimination based on language is eradicated.

                    Every coin has two sides,we forgot our culture and took after our oppressors.We started seeing our culture as barbaric,yes some were but a good number of them were not.Being modernn and civilized meant us aping the west,the metrics of measuring modernity is the western lens.The civilisations of the peoples, their various cultures and traditions, their religions, political philosophies and institutions, were eroded or even destroyed.
                </p>
                <h4>What I'd change about that culture</h4>
                <p>Africa needs to rise up and realise if not reclaim it's power,the world has convinced us that we are inferior and we believed them.Let us adopt our own unique education system that works for us,let us have political and social structures that conform to our needs and social structure.It's only through building your own house that you are at liberty to keep changing it to fit you.Until then ,the owner of the hose will always remind you of how many seconds it would take to throw you out of the house.</p>
                
                <h4>2. The narrative of "Love"</h4>
                <p>Love in Africann Traditional Society was purely for a parent and a daughter.Western culture creeped it,went right through our brains and convinced us that what we new as love had different types,they grouped love into eight groups.Soon we started believing and before we knew it it was deep within us.There's increased divorce in marriages,early pregnancies,and so many STIs that came as a result.
                    <br>
                    It was the full
                    right of the parents of the girl and the man to begin to find a wife for
                    their son, and give their daughter to anybody of their choice. The
                    next was for him to wait for them to tell him where and when the
                    marriage would take place.In the 21st Century the work of doing the investigation, finding money and other things is not in the hand of the man. Investigation here means finding out whether the
                    girl's people can give birth without difficulties, a trace of rampant
                    adultery, stealing, and premature death and so on.<br>
                    Due to cultural change, men find their wives on their own without
                    the consent of their parents. They are not willing to know or
                    investigate things about who to marry; they make decisions on
                    where and when the marriage will hold. Which has often times
                    resulted to regrets, abandonment and even quarrel between the two
                    parties. In Africa, both the living and the dead gather during
                    marriage. 
                </p>
                <h4>What can we do about it?</h4>
                <p>I agree arranged marriages are not funny,who wants to get stuck with someone they don't "love" for forever?Well atleast not me.
                    I would advice our generation to go slow on the amount of information we take from the west,let us try to find a point of intersection between our "modern" and our parent's "ancient"

            <h2 class="nav">Navigating through life amidst a global pandemic</h2>
            <p class="p">Covid-19 has not only created a the biggest health crisis but it has also but it has also affected the society in a bigger magnitude.Among those affected are the youths who are currently at home.We all know an idle mind is the devils's workshop.
                This group of the society needs hanling with care,to help them push through.There are some  measures that  can be  put in place to ensure that their physical,mental and spiritual well being is taken care of.
            </p>
            <ul><li><strong>Personal Protective Equipment Making</strong></li></ul>
            <p class="p">The first response to navigating through the pandemic,without them all other measures are in vain.The youths can be trained on how to make masks and have them make and supply,this will ensure that they are engaged and not viable to endulging in destructive activities.</p>
            <ul><li><strong>Psychological Support Group</strong></li></ul>
            <p class="p">With the widespread of distress during this pandemic,77.7% of youths are likely to fall into depresion.That's a large number right?A good number have lost their jobs,some are out of school annd teir system to some extent had been programmed to experience a different environment at this time.
                Change and adjustment is the only thing their system can do now.Some of them work places or learning institutions were their escape from mental abuse or even physical abuse,
                having to deal with that daily is stressing.Mental health can come in handy during this period and this can be done by forming groups for meet,talks and reassurance. 
            </p>

            <ul><li><strong>Volunteer</strong></li></ul>
            <p class="p">Youths can try and find oppotunities within their communities,If there are old people or people whose immunities are low they can help them out.Help vulnerable people to pick groceries,to pick their medicine.They can help in taking are of children whose parents are maybe in the frontline fighting Corona virus or even providing essential services.</p>

            <ul><li><strong>Creating awareness</strong></li></ul>
            <p class="p">There's information overload about the pandemic and a lot of theories on different platforms.Different age groups have different access to information and different interpretation of the same information.
                In our communities,the youths can take it upon themselves to filter the infomrmation disseminate the right kind of information.By educating the elderly on what to do and keeping them abreast with the current state of affairs taking care not to overload them or cause anxiety.
